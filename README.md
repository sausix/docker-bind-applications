# docker-bind-applications

Applications for base Docker image with BIND 9 DNS server: https://hub.docker.com/r/sausix/bind-sql-base-alpine

Based on BIND 9 project of Internet Systems Consortium (https://www.isc.org/bind/)

## Warning
This project offers no guarantees or compensations for damages or offline times. Use at your own risk.

As server admin you have your own duties to follow security topics. This project is fully open source and you may change configurations for your own requirements.

Contributing especially for security is always welcome.


## Sample applications with config examples


### Sample: [primary DNS server](primary)
Simple container with static configuration for primary nameservers.


### Sample: [secondary DNS server](secondary)
Simple container with static configuration for secondary (slave mode) nameservers.

At least one secondary nameserver is required on most top-level-domain providers as backup.


### Sample: [secondary DNS server with simple config generator](secondary-auto)
Simple container with dynamic configuration for secondary (slave mode) nameservers.

Secondary server config is generated from environment variables:

```yaml
environment:
  PRIMARY=192.168.16.10
  PRIMARY_ZONES=example.com,example2.com
```

Multiple primary servers may also be declared seperated by comma:

```yaml
environment:
  PRIMARY=192.168.16.10,192.168.16.20
  PRIMARY_ZONES=example.com,example2.com
```

No persistent volumes are needed. Cache data is stored in `tmpfs` mounts.

Zone data is being fetched on each restart and on notifications sent by primary server.


### Sample: [Primary DNS server with MariaDB backend](primary-sql)
**Work in progress**
Application with MariaDB (MySQL) database interface as DNS data source.

Requires a connection (or socket) to a working SQL server.


### Sample: primary-sql-complete
**Work in progress**

Full framework with MariaDB (MySQL) server instance, SQL configuration and admin webinterface to manage all DNS zones.



### Sample: dyndns
**Work in progress**

Your own DynDNS service without limits and restrictions


## Common configuration
Create your own container from a specific application.

Copy a subfolder to your server (or clone everything).

Enter the directory.

Modify `docker-compose.yml` as you need.

You may bind your DNS service to your public interfaces only if you like.

Add/modify environment variables to modify your container's behaviour.

To create and run the container: (`sudo`) `docker-compose up -d`

To stop and remove the container: (`sudo`) `docker-compose down`


## Volumes
`/etc/bind`

May be used directly for custom configs.

If init scripts present, they could modify files in this location.

May be mounted as tmpfs if there is no persistent data and config gets generated by init scripts completely.

`/var/named`

May be used directly for custom zone data.

If init scripts present, they could modify files in this location.

May be mounted as tmpfs if there is no persistent data and config gets generated by init scripts completely.


## Config mounts
### Container init scripts (init.d/)
Scripts may be provided for tasks in each application before BIND 9 service starts.

Must/may be mounted as needed from within a directory into `/container/init.d/`. Should be mounted read only.


### Config source files (bind-config/)
Some config source files may be provided as static config and for copy operations.

Must/may be mounted as needed from within a directory into `/container/bind-config`. Should be mounted read only.


## Sample init-scripts

**10-apply-config.sh**

Copies file to locations if present in `/container/bind-config`.

| Mounted source | Destination |
|---|---|
| `/container/bind-config/*.conf` | `/etc/bind/` |
| `/container/bind-config/*.key*` | `/etc/bind/` |
| `/container/default-zones/*.zone` | `/var/named/` |
| `/container/bind-config/*.zone` | `/var/named/` |


Environment variables:

| ENV | Description | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `${APPLY_CONFIG}` | Enables this script | `yes`(default) or `no` |
| `${APPLY_VAR_CLEAN}"` | Clears `/var/named` before further init operations | `yes` or `no`(default) |
| `${APPLY_CONFIG_CLEAN}` | Clears `/etc/bind` before further operations | `yes`(default) or `no` |


**15-generate-zones-from-env.sh**

Generates secondary zone definitions from environment variables into `/etc/bind/named.local-gen.conf`

Environment variables:

| ENV | Description | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `${GENERATE_ZONES}` | Enables this script | `yes`(default) or `no` |
| `${PRIMARY}"` | Primary server's ip addresses, seperated by comma | eg. `10.10.10.10` or `10.10.10.10,10.10.10.20` |
| `${PRIMARY_ZONES}` | Comma seperated list of zones | eg. `example.com,example2.com` |


**20-check-bind-keys.sh**

Acquires bind.keys file.

Environment variables:

| ENV | Values |
|---|---|
| `${BIND_KEYS_ACQUIRE}` | `yes` or `no` or *anything* (default) for automatic creation if missing |
| `${BIND_KEYS_FILE}` | `/etc/bind/bind.keys` (default if not set) |

**30-create-rndc-key.sh**

Creates rndc key and configuration files

| ENV | Values |
|---|---|
| `${RNDC_KEY_GENERATE}` | `yes` (overwrite) or `no` or *anything* for automatic creation if missing |
| `${RNDC_CONF_CREATE}` | `yes` or `no`(default). This config file is redundant with default config for rndc program. |
